# UsabilityHub-Clone

This is a mini project in which I created a clone of UsabilityHub's landing page to learn how to use the AOS library of javascript for animation and to revise HTML and CSS fundamentals.

## Features

- Contains a variety of sections.
- Attractive and appealing user interface.
- Complete responsiveness across all devices.
- Wonderful animations throughout the website.
